# 🎉 Final Setup - Video Proxy Fix

## What Was Fixed

The video URLs from AllAnime API require special headers (Referer) that the browser's HTML5 video player can't send directly. I've added a **proxy endpoint** in the backend that handles this.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`main.py`)
- ✅ Added `/api/proxy/video` endpoint
- ✅ Streams video with proper headers
- ✅ Handles CORS and referrer requirements

### Frontend (`VideoPlayer.jsx`)
- ✅ Updated to use proxy URL instead of direct URL
- ✅ Better error handling

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Restart Backend (If Running)

1. **Stop the backend** (Press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)
2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Use the Easy Script

```bash
# Just double-click: run_both.bat
# It will restart everything
```

## How It Works Now

### Before (Direct URL - Didn't Work):
```
Frontend → Video URL → AllAnime Server ❌ (CORS/Headers blocked)
```

### After (Proxied - Works!):
```
Frontend → Backend Proxy → AllAnime Server ✅
           (adds headers)
```

## Testing

1. **Restart backend** to load new proxy endpoint
2. **Refresh frontend** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. **Click any episode** - Video should now play!

Try episode 1:
- Home → Romance Dawn Arc → Episode 1
- Video should load and play

## What the Proxy Does

```python
# Backend adds these headers automatically:
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0...',
    'Referer': 'https://allmanga.to',  # Required!
    'Accept': '*/*',
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If video still doesn't play:

1. **Check backend is running** with new code:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Should see: "Video loaded successfully"
   - If error, check the error message

3. **Test proxy directly**:
   ```bash
   # Get a video URL first
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/episode/1/video
   
   # Then test proxy (replace URL)
   curl "http://localhost:8000/api/proxy/video?url=VIDEO_URL_HERE"
   ```

### If backend won't start:

Make sure you have all dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Success Indicators

✅ Backend shows: `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`
✅ Frontend loads without errors
✅ Click episode → Video starts playing
✅ Can seek, pause, play normally

## Performance Note

The video is now streamed **through your backend**, which:
- ✅ Fixes CORS and header issues
- ✅ Allows video to play
- ⚠️ Uses your server's bandwidth (not a problem for local use)

For production deployment, consider:
- Using a CDN
- Caching video segments
- Rate limiting

## 🎊 You're All Set!

After restarting the backend, your One Piece Viewer should be **fully functional** with working video playback!

**Test it:**
1. Restart backend
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Click any episode
4. **Watch One Piece! 🏴‍☠️**

**Enjoy your complete anime streaming app!** 🎉
