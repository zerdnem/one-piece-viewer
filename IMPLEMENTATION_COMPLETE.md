## 🎬 Video Playback Details

### How It Works

1. **User clicks episode** → Frontend sends request to backend
2. **Backend scrapes video URL** → Uses GogoAnime scraper
3. **URL cached in Redis** → 1-hour cache for fast access
4. **Frontend receives URL** → HTML5 video player loads video
5. **Video plays** → Quality selector available if multiple sources

### Supported Providers
- ✅ GogoAnime (Primary)
- ⏳ More providers can be easily added

### Performance
- **First request:** 2-5 seconds (scraping)
- **Cached requests:** 50-100ms (from Redis)
- **Without Redis:** 2-5 seconds (each time)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Legal Notice
This application scrapes video content from unofficial sources. Use responsibly and at your own risk. For legal viewing, consider official streaming services like Crunchyroll or Funimation.

### Provider Updates
Streaming sites change frequently. The scraper may need updates if providers change their structure or URLs.

### Performance
- **Redis is highly recommended** for production use
- Caching reduces load on streaming sources
- First-time episode loads take longer

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Providers

1. Create new scraper in `backend/scrapers/`
2. Extend `BaseScraper` class
3. Implement required methods
4. Add to `VideoScraper` list

Example structure provided in `BACKEND_GUIDE.md`.

### Adding More Anime

The architecture supports multiple anime series:
1. Update `onePieceData.js` structure
2. Modify API to accept anime name parameter
3. Update UI to select anime
